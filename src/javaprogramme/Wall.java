/**
 * Write a class with the name Wall. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name width
 * and height of type double.
 * The class needs to have two constructors. The first constructor does not have any parameters (no-arg
 * constructor). The second constructor has parameters width and height of type double and it needs to
 * initialize the fields. In case the width is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0, in case the
 * height parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the height field value to 0.
 * Write the following methods (instance methods):
 * * Method named getWidth without any parameters, it needs to return the value of width field.
 * * Method named getHeight without any parameters, it needs to return the value of height field.
 * * Method named setWidth with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the value of the width
 * field. If the parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0.
 * * Method named setHeight with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the value of the
 * height field. If the parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the height field value to 0.
 * * Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the area of the wall.
